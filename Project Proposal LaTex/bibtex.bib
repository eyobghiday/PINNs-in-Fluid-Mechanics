abstract = {Sixth edition. "Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach, Sixth Edition by AIAA Fellow Dr. Daniel P. Raymer provides updates to what has become a standard textbook and reference throughout the world on the subject of aircraft conceptual design. This new edition expands and updates this modern classic including timely topics such as "green aircraft" and electric propulsion, but retains the completeness and readability that have placed it in universities and design offices everywhere. The book covers every topic necessary to the understanding of aircraft design, such as aerodynamics, structures, stability and control, propulsion, etc., with an overview introduction starting from first principles. All are discussed from the point of view of the designer, not the specialist in any given topic area"--},

abstract = {Aircraft industry is still in the early stages of pure electric propulsion systems development, the main concern is the significant mass of batteries. As such, hybrid electric systems have gained much stakeholder attention in the recent years. At the same time, interest in distributed propulsion systems is also increasing, due to the improvement in aerodynamic efficiency compared to conventional configurations. This paper investigates these two fields, presenting the results of two correlated studies. The first study deals with: i. The relevance of the purely electric propulsion systems and their comparison to conventional ones and ii. Hybrid propulsion systems and the suitable hybrid configuration for light aircraft using the normalized range factor and range analysis. The outcome of the first investigation has been used in the second study to build a distributed propulsion architecture and complete a comparative CFD analysis to demonstrate the advantages of the new concept compared to the baseline configuration.}

@article{PIDControl, abstract = {In this paper, the three principle control effects found
in present controllers are examined and practical names
and units of measurement are proposed for each effect.
Corresponding units are proposed for a classification of
industrial processes in terms of the two principal char-
acteristics affecting their controllability. Formulas are
given which enable the controller settings to be determined
from the experimental or calculated values of the lag and
unit reaction rate of the process to be controlled. These
units form the basis of a quick method for adjusting a
controller on the job. The effect of varying each controller
setting is shown in a series of chart records. It is believed
that the conceptions of control presented in this paper will
be of assistance in the adjustment of existing controller
applications and in the design of new installations.},
