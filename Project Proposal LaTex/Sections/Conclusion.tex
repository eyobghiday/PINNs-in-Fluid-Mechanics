This proposal aims to investigate the application of PINNs in fluid mechanics to predict the flow field around a fluid object by solving the Navier-Stokes equations. The proposed methodology involves generating a dataset of Navier-Stokes solutions, developing a PINN model to predict the flow field, training the PINN model using the dataset of Navier-Stokes solutions, and evaluating its performance. The expected outcomes include a physics-informed neural network model, insights into the performance and limitations of the PINN model, and a foundation for further research.

\subsection{Alternative or Extension to PINN's}
If a sound progress is not made on the implementation of PINNS by the end of this month, I will try exploring on Multinoimial Bayes Function for comparison. A MultinomialNB analysis is a probabilistic classification algorithm used in natural language processing and text mining. It is based on the Bayes theorem and assumes that the features are independent of each other. MultinomialNB is often used for document classification, sentiment analysis, and spam filtering. Therefore, the comparison between PINNs and MultinomialNB analysis depends on the specific problem being solved. Although I quite feel that PINNs may be more appropriate than MultinomialNB analysis on this class, if only problem involving text classification or sentiment analysis are discussed then during a topic the MultinomialNB may be a better choice than PINNs.
