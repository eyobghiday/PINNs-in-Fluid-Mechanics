The flow field around a fluid object, such as an airfoil, is an essential problem in fluid mechanics that has practical applications in various fields, including aerospace, marine, and civil engineering. Solving the Navier-Stokes equations to predict the flow field around a fluid object is a challenging task due to the complex geometry and boundary conditions involved. Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising technique to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) accurately and efficiently. This proposal aims to investigate the application of PINNs in fluid mechanics to predict the flow field around a fluid object by solving the Navier-Stokes equations.

A more detailed explanation of how PINNs can be used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow around an airfoil. The funndamental Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of fluids and are given by:

$$\rho\left(\frac{\partial\textbf{v}}{\partial t}+\textbf{v}\cdot\nabla\textbf{v}\right)=-\nabla p+\mu\nabla^2\textbf{v}+\textbf{f}$$
$$\nabla\cdot\textbf{v}=0$$

where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $\textbf{v}$ is the velocity field, $p$ is the pressure field, $\mu$ is the fluid viscosity, and $\textbf{f}$ is the external force field.
