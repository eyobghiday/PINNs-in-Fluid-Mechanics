Depending on the class progress and time period, the expected outcomes of this proposal to present physics-informed neural network model that accurately and efficiently predicts the flow field around a fluid object by solving the required equations. Insights into the performance and limitations of the PINN model in fluid mechanics applications. A foundation for further research into the application of PINNs will require analysing more complex fluid mechanics problems, such as multiphase flows and turbulent flows.
