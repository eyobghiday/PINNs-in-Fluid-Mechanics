@article{Willis1980,
abstract = {Scattering problems in elastodynamics are formulated in terms of integral equations, whose kernels are obtained from the Green's function for a comparison body. The comparison body will usually be taken as homogeneous and elastic in applications but, at least formally, there is no bar to its being inhomogeneous, viscoelastic and non-local. The novel feature of the formulation is the introduction of a "momentum polarization" to cope with density variations in a way that exactly parallels the stress polarization's correspondence with variations in moduli. To illustrate the use of the equations, scattering by an ellipsoidal inhomogeneity in a generally anisotropic matrix is studied in the Rayleigh limit and an asymptotic formula for its scattering cross-section is given. Detailed results are presented for a spheroidal inhomogeneity in an isotropic matrix, with explicit limiting forms for the scattering cross-sections of penny-shaped cracks, rigid circular discs and rigid needles. {\textcopyright} 1980.},

@article{FernandezdelaMata2023,
abstract = {The last decade has seen a rise in the number and variety of techniques available for data-driven simulation of physical phenomena. One of the most promising approaches is Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which can combine both data, obtained from sensors or numerical solvers, and physics knowledge, expressed as partial differential equations. In this work, we investigated the suitability of PINNs to replace current available numerical methods for physics simulations. Although the PINN approach is general and independent of the complexity of the underlying physics equations, a selection of typical heat transfer and fluid dynamics problems was proposed and multiple PINNs were comprehensibly trained and tested to solve them. When PINNs were used as learned simulators, the outcome of our experiments was not entirely satisfactory as not enough accuracy was achieved even though optimal configurations and long training times were used. The main cause for this limitation was found to be the lack of adequate activation functions and specialized architectures, since they proved to have a notable impact on the final accuracy of each model. In turn, PINN architectures showed an accurate behavior when used for parameter inference of partial differential equations from data.},

abstract = {In this final chapter we will apply the idea of Green's functions to PDEs, enabling us to solve the wave equation, diffusion equation and Laplace equation in unbounded domains. We will also see how to solve the inhomogeneous (i.e. forced) version of these equations, and uncover a relationship, known as Duhamel's principle, between these two classes of problem. In our construction of Green's functions for the heat and wave equation, Fourier transforms play a starring role via the 'differentiation becomes multiplication' rule. We derive Green's identities that enable us to construct Green's functions for Laplace's equation and its inhomogeneous cousin, Poisson's equation. We conclude with a look at the method of images — one of Lord Kelvin's favourite pieces of mathematical trickery. 10.1 Fourier transforms for the heat equation Consider the Cauchy problem for the heat equation ∂$\phi$ ∂t = D∇ 2 $\phi$ (10.1) on R n × [0, ∞), where D is the diffusion constant and where $\phi$ obeys the conditions $\phi$| R n ×{0} = f (x) and lim |x|→∞ $\phi$(x, t) = 0 ∀ t . (10.2) Taking the Fourier transform w.r.t. the spatial variables we have ∂ ∂ $\phi$(k, t) = −D|k| $\phi$(k, t) (10.3) with initial conditio{\~{n}} $\phi$(k, 0) f (k). This equation has a unique solution satisfying the initial conditions, given b $\phi$(k, t) f (k) e −D|k| 2 t . (10.4) Our solution $\phi$(x, t) itself is the inverse Fourier transform of the product o f (k) with the Gaussian e −D|k| 2 t , and the convolution theorem tells us that this will be the convolution of the initial data f (x) = F −1 f ] with the inverse Fourier transform of the Gaussian. On the third problem sheet you've already shown that, for a Gaussian in one variable F[e −a 2 x 2 ] = √ $\pi$},

@article{TANG2022186,
abstract = {Solving linear system of equations stemming from Laplacian operators is at the heart of a wide range of applications. Due to the sparsity of the linear systems, iterative solvers such as Conjugate Gradient and Multigrid are usually employed when the solution has a large number of degrees of freedom. These iterative solvers can be seen as sparse approximations of the Green's function for the Laplacian operator. In this paper we propose a machine learning approach that regresses a Green's function from boundary conditions. This is enabled by a Green's function that can be effectively represented in a multi-scale fashion, drastically reducing the cost associated with a dense matrix representation. Additionally, since the Green's function is solely dependent on boundary conditions, training the proposed neural network does not require sampling the right-hand side of the linear system. We show results that our method outperforms state of the art Conjugate Gradient and Multigrid methods.},
